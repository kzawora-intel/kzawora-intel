- 👋 Hi, I’m Konrad. I used to work at Habana (Intel) and I made some high-performance AI software. Now I'm doing something else, so this account is likely to be pretty abandoned.
- I built [vLLM-Gaudi vLLM plugin](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-gaudi/) and [vLLM-fork for Gaudi](https://github.com/HabanaAI/vllm-fork). I liked it a lot.
- That's my cat in the avatar.
